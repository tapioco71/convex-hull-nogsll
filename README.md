## Description

The algorithm is a modified Graham's scan from
https://cp-algorithms.com/geometry/grahams-scan-convex-hull.html
To use the program just type:

CL-USER> (cvhng::main (mapcar #'(lambda (x)
                                (make-array 2
                                            :element-type 'double-float
                                            :initial-contents x))
                              '((0d0 0d0)
                                (2d0 0d0)
                                (0d0 2d0)
                                (2d0 2d0)
                                (0d0 4d0)
                                (2d0 4d0)
                                (0d0 6d0)
                                (2d0 6d0)
                                (0d0 8d0)
                                (2d0 8d0)
                                (4d0 6d0)
                                (4d0 8d0)
                                (6d0 6d0)
                                (6d0 8d0)
                                (8d0 6d0)
                                (8d0 8d0))))

 (#(8.0d0 6.0d0) #(8.0d0 8.0d0)) (#(8.0d0 8.0d0) #(0.0d0 8.0d0))
 (#(0.0d0 8.0d0) #(0.0d0 0.0d0)))

The verbosity could be omitted for zero messages from the program. The input is
a list of grid:foreign-array (dimension 2) for the vertex points.
The second input is the maximum number of iterations admitted for computations.
The third is the verbose flag and could be nil or t. The function returns
the couple of vertices identifying a polygon edge.
